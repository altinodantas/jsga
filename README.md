# jsga
JsGA is a simple example on how to optimize a multimodal function by using a canonical Genetic Algorithm implemented with JavaScript.
The algorithm was designed over the Function F6, that is:
![](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?f(x,y)=0.5&plus;\frac{\sin^2(\sqrt{x^2&space;&plus;&space;y^2})-0.5}{[1&plus;0.001&space;\cdot&space;(x^2&space;&plus;&space;y^2)]^2})

## Parameters
The page presents some parameters through which one may notices their impact on the algorithm behavior.  
 - Population size
 - Matation rate
 - Crossover rate
 - Maximal of generations
 - K-tournament
